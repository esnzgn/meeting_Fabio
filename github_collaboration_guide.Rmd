## description

Let's walk through how you can accept a collaboration request on GitHub and allow your collaborator to make and merge changes to your repository.

### Step 1: Accept the Invitation

If someone wants to collaborate with you on a GitHub repository, they will typically add you as a **collaborator**. You will receive an **email notification** and also a **notification on GitHub**.

- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log into your account.
- Click on your profile icon and go to **"Your repositories"**.
- Look for the **"Invitations"** tab or check your **notifications**.
- Click **"Accept invitation"**.

Once accepted, you will have access based on the permission level they gave you (read, write, or admin).

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository (if you don't have it locally)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name
```

---

### Step 3: Create a New Branch and Make Changes

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
# Make some changes to files...
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new feature"
git push origin my-feature-branch
```

---

### Step 4: Open a Pull Request

Go to the repository on GitHub and youâ€™ll see a banner to open a **Pull Request**.

- Click **"Compare & Pull Request"**
- Add a title and description
- Click **"Create Pull Request"**

---

### Step 5: Merging the Changes

If you're an admin or have write access, you can now **merge** the pull request.

- Go to the **Pull Requests** tab
- Review the changes
- Click **"Merge pull request"**
- Then click **"Confirm merge"**

ðŸŽ‰ Your collaboratorâ€™s changes are now part of the main codebase.

## Example

Letâ€™s say Anna invites Ehsan to collaborate on her repo called `genomics-analysis`.

1. Anna sends an invite to Ehsan.
2. Ehsan goes to GitHub, sees the invite, and clicks **Accept**.
3. Ehsan clones the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Anna/genomics-analysis.git
    cd genomics-analysis
    ```
4. He creates a new branch and pushes his changes.
5. He opens a pull request.
6. Anna reviews and merges it.

## Tips

- Use **Issues** to coordinate with collaborators.
- Always **pull before you push** to avoid conflicts.
- Protect your `main` branch with **branch protection rules**.

Done! Now you're collaborating effectively on GitHub. ðŸš€
